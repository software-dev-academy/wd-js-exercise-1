# Lab 1

## Preparation

### 1) HTML -> DOM-tree

Your task is to convert the HTML file [`preparation/part1/document.html`](https://github.com/davyie/SDA-js_labs/blob/master/lab1/preparation/part1/document.html) to a DOM-tree similar to the one found 
[here on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp).
 
 *Some tips:*
 - Check the lecture about DOM objects and make sure you understand it.
 - If needed, read the tutorial in W3School about DOM.
 - Read the HTML file carefully.
 
### 2) DOM-tree -> HTML

As you've managed to convert the HTML to a DOM-tree, you should now be able to do the reverse. Try converting the tree 
found in [`preparation/part2/dom_tree.pdf`](https://github.com/davyie/SDA-js_labs/blob/master/lab1/preparation/part2/dom_tree.pdf) into an HTML-file.  
*Note:* Styling is optional.

## Calculator

In this task you are to implement the functionality for a simple calculator. You have been given template html and css  
in the folder [`calculator_template`](https://github.com/davyie/SDA-js_labs/tree/master/lab1/calculator_template) but as you will notice, clicking the buttons does nothing. Your task is to add 
javascript code so that the buttons do asexpected (like a normal calculator). This will require you to learn how to 
traverse/select elements from the DOM-tree and handle their values. Functionality should be added for all buttons.

*Some tips:*
- You should let your code run after the DOMContentLoaded event is triggered. See link below. Also, try reasoning about 
why this is important to do.
- Pay attention to the classes and/or ids of the elements in the HTML-DOM. They can be useful for selecting elements. 
Feel free to customize the elements and add your own classes and/or ids.
